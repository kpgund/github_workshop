## 1. Create a new repository and add a Rproject to it
In the following example we are going to be creating a repository for an exisiting project we have been working on, moth presence. 

### 1.1 Go into your GitHub account page and select `Repositories` tab. 

![Press the green "New" button. This will create a new repository](C:/Users/kzg5211/OneDrive - The Pennsylvania State University/1_PhD/Workshops/github_workshop/img/github_newrepo.png)

\

### 1.2 Set up a new repository 
![Give it a name (doesn't have to be what I have in the example photo).](C:/Users/kzg5211/OneDrive - The Pennsylvania State University/1_PhD/Workshops/github_workshop/img/github_createrepo.png) \
Select "Private" \
Select "Add a README file" 
\
**Once all the information is filled out select "Create Repository"**

### 1.3 Copy ssh key link for this repository
![In order to connect this repo with an Rproject, we need to connect this repo at a project on our computer](C:/Users/kzg5211/OneDrive - The Pennsylvania State University/1_PhD/Workshops/github_workshop/img/github_copyrepo.png)

\

## 2. Create a new Version Control RProject
### 2.1 open R
### 2.2 Go to File -> New Project
### 2.3 Select the Version Control Project 
![Select the Version Control project. This option allows us to connect our repository the quickest](C:/Users/kzg5211/OneDrive - The Pennsylvania State University/1_PhD/Workshops/github_workshop/img/github_createnewproject.png)

\

### 2.4 Select the `Git` Project from the Version Control options
![Select `Git`](C:/Users/kzg5211/OneDrive - The Pennsylvania State University/1_PhD/Workshops/github_workshop/img/github_gitversion.png)

\

### 2.5 Copy the ssh key address from step 1.3
![Copy the address from step 1.3 into "Repository URL". ](C:/Users/kzg5211/OneDrive - The Pennsylvania State University/1_PhD/Workshops/github_workshop/img/github_clonerepo.png)
\
The project directory name should auto populate to what you choose as the repo name. \
Select "Browse" and choose a location that makes sense for your organization system. 
\

### 2.6 Create Project

Once everything is how you would like it to be select `Create Project` The new Rproject will pop up. 

\

### 2.7. Bring your existing project over
The simplest way to do this is to cut and paste what you would like to have in this repository. \
![In RStudio, check the Git pane and the file browser for the updated files. ](C:/Users/kzg5211/OneDrive - The Pennsylvania State University/1_PhD/Workshops/github_workshop/img/github_filespopulatingGIT.png)
\


## 3. Start tracking files in your repository
![Next to each folder/file is a color/symbol.](C:/Users/kzg5211/OneDrive - The Pennsylvania State University/1_PhD/Workshops/github_workshop/img/github_tracking.png)
\

In our Git Pane we see that our folders/files are yellow, this means they are "untracked" 
\
We will want to "Add" or "Stage" each of these folders/files 
\

### 3.1. Commit changes and push to repository. 
Select "Commit" in the ribbon on the Git Pane. \
![Next to each folder/file click on the white checkbox to "Add" or "Stage" the files/folders](C:/Users/kzg5211/OneDrive - The Pennsylvania State University/1_PhD/Workshops/github_workshop/img/github_committingFiles.png)
![Once the all of them have been selected, the status should change to "A" for "Added"](C:/Users/kzg5211/OneDrive - The Pennsylvania State University/1_PhD/Workshops/github_workshop/img/github_firstcommit.png)
\
For this first commit, we will have a single commit message for all files/folders. However, we recommend that commit messages should be specific for specific changes happening to scripts / files. This will allow you to keep track of work better. 
\
**Press the commit button to start tracking these files. However, this DOES NOT send the changes to GitHub. However, each commit is saved on your local machine as a snapshot in time.**
\

### 3.2 Pushing committed changes to Github
For changes to be uploaded to Github we need to **Push** our tracked commits. \
Once all of your changes have been tracked through commits and commit messages, select the Push button in the top right hand corner (it has a green up arrow next to it). \
This will send all of the commits (snapshots) off to GitHub.
